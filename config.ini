# Capture resolution and FPS
# Common USB webcam resolutions (width x height):
#   160x120   - Minimal, very low CPU, poor quality
#   320x240   - Low res, ~4x less CPU than 640x480, good for presence detection
#   640x480   - Standard VGA (default), good balance of quality and performance
#   800x600   - SVGA, higher quality but more CPU
#   1280x720  - HD 720p, high quality, significantly more CPU
#   1920x1080 - Full HD, highest quality, very high CPU (not recommended for Pi)
#
# For blind spot monitoring (presence detection), 320x240 or 640x480 is sufficient
